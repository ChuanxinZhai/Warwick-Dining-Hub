# Warwick-Dining-Hub
Warwick-Dining-Hub is an interactive hub for the University of Warwickâ€™s dining facilities, providing view/add products, book a slot, submit feedback and search functions to students, staff and restaurant merchants. There are three main facilities in this website, the Beautiful Duck, StarBucks Cafe and Terrace Bar, which provide food, coffee and wine, respectively.

If you want to see my other pages, you need to see my raw project because I didn't write the page jump logic code in html. I wrote the routes in app.py file.
